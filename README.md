My password generator will take both inputs whether true or falser and create the password according to the users inputs. It will not allow you input less than 8 characters or any more than 128 characters. This project was a bit of a head scracther most of the time, but thankfully I got through it with some help from the TA's and peers. And plenty of other resources as well. I am happy with my work and how it came to be.
